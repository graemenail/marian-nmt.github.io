## Translation with a pre-trained model

### Downloading the model

### Data preprocessing

### Translation

As in this example we use a model trained by the Nematus toolkit, model
architecture details needs to be provided as command-line options or in a
config file.  Models trained with Marian already contain information on the
architecture needed for decoder.

## Training a basic model

### Data preprocessing

### Validation metrics

### Training

### Evaluation
