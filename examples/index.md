## Basic examples

* **[Translating with Amun](/examples/translating/)**:
The files and scripts described in this section can be found in {% github_link
marian/examples/translate %}. They demonstrate how to translate with Amun using
Edinburgh's German-English WMT2016 single model and ensemble.
* **[Training with Marian](/examples/training/)**: The files
and scripts described in this section can be found in
{% github_link marian/examples/training %}. They have been adapted from the
Romanian-English sample from <https://github.com/rsennrich/wmt16-scripts>.
We also add the back-translated data from <http://data.statmt.org/rsennrich/wmt16_backtranslations/>
as desribed in [Edinburgh's WMT16 paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-2323).
The resulting system should be competitive or even slightly better than
reported in that paper.
* **[Custom models with Marian](/examples/tutorial/)**: Building and modifing a
basic Sutskever-style sequence-to-sequence model.

## Use cases

* **[Winning system of the WMT 2016 APE shared task](/examples/postedit/)**:
This page provides data and model files for our shared task winning APE system
described in [Log-linear Combinations of Monolingual and Bilingual Neural
Machine Translation Models for Automatic
Post-Editing](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-2378).
